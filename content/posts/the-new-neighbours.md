With the pandemic in full swing, and the Canadian housing market hotter than ever, there's been a flurry of action in my neighbourhood as houses get bought and sold at a dizzying rate. A common concern with families coming in is whether it's going to disrupt your way of living. Will they be noisy? Will they be rude? Will they have tacky sense of design? Sometimes though, you get lucky.

I had some new neighbours move in just this past weekend, and while they've chosen my shed, I can honestly say I couldn't be happier.

That's right, I've got baby foxes living in my yard. Are they adorable? Yes. Do I feel lucky? Yes. Does my shed smell like fox pee now? Also yes.

It just goes to show that if you refuse to go into nature for long enough, nature will happily come to you.
