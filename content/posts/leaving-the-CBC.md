In December of 2015, I left my job and my career as an automotive mechanical engineer. At the time I didn't know what exactly where I'd end up, but I knew I was very unhappy where I was. I felt burnt out, uninspired, and like I'd already reached a dead end. The last thing I wanted to do was design screws for the rest of my life, and the sooner that I got out the better.
