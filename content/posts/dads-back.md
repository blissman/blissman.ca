It's been about a week now since our new neighbours have moved in, and during that time we've seen mum busting her foxy little butt to feed the kits, but no dad. While red foxes are known to be monogamous, we speculated that maybe something had happened to him. An off-leash dog? Should we call the city to have bylaw come by and put up some signs? Or maybe *this* particular fox wasn't so monogamous? How dare he leave his baby-mama to feed five kits on shrews and milk alone?

It turns out that our concern and indignation was unfounded, because today dad returned to the den! 

Dad's energy is a little more chill than mum's. While she's usually on high alert, dad's . . . having a sit on the hill looking over the field.

While he does so, the kits dig in to a nutritious breakfast (a disemboweled rabbit, courtesy of their papa). Gotta get that protein for the gainz!

Like some of my favorite cats, equal parts vicious and adorable <3.
