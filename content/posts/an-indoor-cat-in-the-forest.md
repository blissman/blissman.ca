I've always self-identified my spirit animal as the noble raccoon. Something about its bandit face and clever hands finding discarded food (or trash) always spoke to me (#4age4lyfe). Those who know me best however tell me that I am in reality much closer to a bougie indoor cat; preferring my beds soft and my plumbing indoors.
