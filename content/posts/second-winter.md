This week marked "second winter": Canada's annual surprise snowfall in Spring. Each year, Canadians young and old remark that they "can't believe this is happening" and that "it doesn't usually snow this late, does it?" (in spite of the long-standing tradition). I suppose it's a kindness of human memory to forget the trauma.

It's been a few days since I've seen my new neighbours, with only paw prints in the snow to confirm their continued residence. I was honestly getting a bit worried. Should I put a space heater in the shed? Do foxes eat pastrami? These are the questions that keep me up at night.

As the sun came out this afternoon though, the snow started to melt and our little fuzzballs came out to celebrate (relatable, really).

That's the kind of joy we've been missing this pandemic. Keeping living your best lives, little buddies!
