When I was young(er), my dad worked seven days a week to try and provide the kids with the advantages he didn't have growing up. It meant that he was often tired, and a little bit grouchy, but he still made an effort to spend time with us on the weekends when he could. A Saturday afternoon doing something fun with dad didn't happen that often, but it was always a good time.

This last Saturday here in Ottawa was a real beauty. Sunny skies, and a high of 20&deg;C made it the perfect weather for being out-and-about. The foxes took the opportunity to have their own afternoon playing with dad in the yard:

Watching these little guys play really makes you appreciate how cute they are:
